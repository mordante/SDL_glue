This library adds a glue layer between SDL 1.2 and SDL 2.0.

The SDL project [1] is working on the upcoming SDL 2.0 library. This version is
not compatible with SDL 1.2.x. This library is a small glue layer to get
SDL 1.2.x compatible code working with SDL 2.0, with the minimal amount of
changes to the original source code. The headers of this library will have no
effect when compiled with SDL 1.2, so they can be safely used unconditionally
with SDL 1.2 and SDL 2.0.

During the development of SDL 2.0, then called SDL 1.3, there was a
compatibility layer in SDL. This layer has been removed. The last version [2][3]
of that layer has been copied in the SDL_compat subdirectory. The code in this
library is heavily based on that code. Another source of influence is the `SDL
1.2 to 2.0 Migration Guide' [4].

The initial goal to work on this library was to get The Battle for Wesnoth [5]
working with SDL 2.0. So the library focusses on the parts of the SDL library
that this project uses.

The library is in the alpha phase.
